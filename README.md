## 🇮🇳 India-Specific Features

### GST Processing
- **Smart GST Split**: Automatically determines IGST vs CGST+SGST based on supplier GSTIN and Place of Supply
- **Tax Validation**: Derives GST rates from invoice math and identifies under-taxation
- **Compliance Check**: Computes additional GST payable when invoices are under-taxed

### TDS Processing
- **Section Classification**: Automatically selects appropriate TDS sections (194J, 194C, 194H, 194I, etc.)
- **Rate Application**: Applies correct TDS rates with 206AA/206AB penalty overrides
- **Base Calculation**: Computes TDS on base or gross amounts per regulatory requirements

### GL Code Mapping
- **Intelligent Matching**: Vendor-based matching → HSN/SAC prefix logic → fallback rules
- **Finance-Friendly**: Rules maintained in Google Sheets by Finance team

## 🚀 Key Features

### ⚡ Speed & Efficiency
- **30-second processing**: Upload to audit-ready result
- **99.93% time reduction**: From 5 days to 30 seconds
- **66% staff reduction**: 3 people → 1-2 reviewers

### 🎯 Accuracy & Intelligence
- **High-accuracy OCR**: Tuned specifically for invoice formats
- **Deterministic rules**: Combined with LLM guardrails
- **Explainable AI**: Returns rationale for every tax decision

### 📊 Auditability & Compliance

- **Human oversight**: Reviewer can edit before final processing
- **ERP-ready output**: Clean JSON with GL codes and totals

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Upload**: PDF invoice uploaded via HTTP endpoint
2. **OCR**: LlamaParse converts PDF → structured Markdown
3. **Extract**: OpenAI extracts structured JSON fields
4. **Enrich**: Tax Agent adds TDS section/rate/amount + GST validation + GL mapping
5. **Review**: Auto-filled form presented for human verification
6. **Store**: Complete audit trail saved to Data Store
7. **Output**: ERP-ready JSON with all tax and accounting data
